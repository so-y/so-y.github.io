abstract: '<p><b>ASTMiner</b> is a library for mining of path-based representations of code and more. ASTminer lets you create end2end pipeline of data processing. It allows convert source code, cloned from VCS to suitable for training datasets. To do that, astminer provides multiple steps to handle data: (1) filters to remove redundant samples from data, (2) label extractors to create label for each tree, (3) storages to define storage format.</p>'
