abstract: '<p><b>Revizor</b> is a plugin for PyCharm that takes the recurrent change patterns and highlights potential places for their application in the developer’s code editor. We use graph-based code change representations gathered from 120 GitHub repositories by Python Change Miner. Behind the scenes, the plugin runs an inspection which builds isomorphic mappings between fine-grained Program Dependence Graphs of the mined patterns and a similar graph of your code and then suggests a relevant quick-fix to apply for the highlighted code fragment.</p>'
