abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. In this paper we are approaching the problem of automatic refactoring detection for object-oriented systems. An approach based on clustering ensembles is proposed, several heuristics to existing algorithms and to filtering and combining their results are discussed. An experimental validation of the proposed approach on an open source project is proposed. The obtained results illustrate that the introduced approach could be successfully used to improve existing integrated development environments, providing developers with one more tool to reduce complexity of their projects</p>"
