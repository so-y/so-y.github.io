abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Software engineers have a wide variety of tools and techniques that can help them improve the quality of their code, but still, a lot of bugs remain undetected. In this paper we build on the idea that if a particular fragment of code is changed too often, it could be caused by some technical or architectural issues, therefore, this fragment requires additional attention from developers. Most teams nowadays use version control systems to track changes in their code and organize cooperation between developers. We propose to use data from version control systems to track the number of changes for each method in a project for a selected time period and display this information within the IDE's code editor. The paper describes such a tool called Topias built as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
